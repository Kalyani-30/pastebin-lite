# Pastebin Lite

A simple Pastebin-like application built using Java and Spring Boot.

## How to run the app locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
3. Run the Spring Boot main class
4. App runs on http://localhost:8088

## Persistence Layer
Currently using in-memory storage (Java Map).

## Design Decisions
- REST APIs used for paste creation and retrieval
- Optional TTL and view-count constraints
- Simple design focused on assignment requirements
